Europe has a lot of really strong teams such as Barcelona, Real Madrid, Liverpool, Manchester City and Bayern Munich. It's tough to reach the top.", "q5": "Are they ready to play in the World Cup this year", "a5": "I think they're ready they've been practicing really hard.", "q6": "How will Neymar fare this season with Paris SG?", "a6": "If had to bet money I would say he will match his stats from last season or surpass them!"}
