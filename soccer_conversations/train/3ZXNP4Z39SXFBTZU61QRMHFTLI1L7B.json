{"q1": "A German team consisting of too many egos was always going to fail at this World Cup.", "a1": "In my opinion its not the players fault but Low's.

Also he believed too much in his older players but most of them are already washed up.", "q2": "Do you think the younger players are ready for the next World Cup?", "a2": "Yeah I think they will, younger players have more stamina.", "q3": "Does it not worry you that they don't have the experience though? ", "a3": "Yes, but I think that their spirit and energy makes up for it. ", "q4": "What do you think about Ozil leaving the team because of the \"racism\" ?", "a4": "He should stay strong and not let anything make him quit something he loves.", "q5": "Yes but he should not fel harrased because of his origins either", "a5": "Ozil is a good player who has had a lot of success for club and country. If he says he is facing racism, I believe him, and understand him leaving the team.", "q6": "that's true nobody deserves that. great talk, have a good night!", "a6": "same for you, goodbye."}
