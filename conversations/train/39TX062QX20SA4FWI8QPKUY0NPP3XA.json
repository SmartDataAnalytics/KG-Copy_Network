But as it is not and 'American' sport it will take some time.", "q4": "Couldn't agree more. America is a very tough market as they are fanatical about their home sports.", "a4": "If they can't make their own World Champion then they are not interested.", "q5": "A big problem is that the media doesn't respect the sport, as if they need to prop up the major leagues of other sports.", "a5": "Years I agree", "q6": "The US Womens team going to the world cup helped push America towards the sport. You think the mens team can do it?", "a6": "No, men are too dramatic. Women play to play the sport and be the best. Men need to just play soccer and take a few pointers from the womens side."}
